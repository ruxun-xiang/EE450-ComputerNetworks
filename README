Finish time: 13th Apr.

Code files: 
   scheduler.cpp, header file: scheduler.h. Use to retrieve current situation of each hospital  and assign patients to them based on the score and distance.
   hospitalA.cpp, hospitalB.cpp, hospitalC.cpp, and they all share the same header file: hospital.h. Used to analysis map file and form a map. Calculate the shortest distance between patients and themselves, and inform the scheduler.
   client.cpp, header file client. Use to inform their location to the scheduler and wait to receive the assignment by the scheduler.
   
Format of message exchanged:
bootup message from hospital to scheduler:
   struct bootUpMessage {
	   int capacity;
	   int occupancy;
   };
   encoded in a char array.

client's location from client to scheduler:
   a pointer to a char encoded in a char array.

client's location from scheduler to hospital:
   a char array

hospital's current situation from hospital to scheduler:
   struct hospitalSituation {
	   float score;
	   float distance;
   }; 
   encoded in a char array

scheduler's reply to client and hospitals the decision 
   a pointer to a char encoded in a char array.
   
Idiosyncrasy: /

Reused code: /

Another Note: the path of the map file is defined in hospital.h.
